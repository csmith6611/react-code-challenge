INCOMPLETE

Vite + typescript infinite scoller

Implement a performance-first infinite scroller that hydrates the data as the scrolls happen

bi-directional intersection observers to identify the viewport and shift it as needed

Non-rendered divs are either skeletons (future data fetching) or simple placeholders that re-render as the user gets closer to them
